Start by forking a project on github. Then, you add whoever needs to be a collaborator to the repo, and then you clone it
by copying the code url and putting it in the right folder from the terminal using "git clone "code url here". After that,
you go into the correct directory and make a new branch of the project by using "git checkout -b 'branch-name'".
At this point, you work on the project like normal until you need to push the changes you made. You first need to make sure
you add the changes by using the command "git add .". After that, you need to commit the changes by using
"git commit -m "Write a comment about what you did here". Now to push the changes, you use the command 
"git push -u branch-name". Now that all your changes have been saved and uploaded back to the git repo, you can do a pull
request by changing the branch on github to your name. Then, click "New Pull Request" and change the base repository button to 
your own forked repo. At this point, you add your TL if need be still, and then submit the actual request.
